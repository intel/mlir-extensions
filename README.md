## Setting up development environment
```sh
conda create -n imex-dev -c intel -c defaults -c conda-forge pip">=21.2.4" pre-commit cmake clang-format tbb-devel lit doxygen

conda activate imex-dev
pre-commit install -f -c ./scripts/.pre-commit-config.yaml
```
Or make sure you have a working c++ compiler, python, clang-format and cmake>3.16 in your path.

## Building
### Linux
**Note**: Make sure to pass `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON` when building LLVM with
CMake so that it installs `FileCheck` to the chosen installation prefix.

#### Convenience Building LLVM/MLIR + IMEX

The script `build_tools/build_imex.py` can build both LLVM/MLIR and IMEX for you. Use
`build_imex.py -h` to look at all the options provided by the script. It is
advisable to use an external lit when building IMEX.

If you want the script to build LLVM and then IMEX, do as follows:

```sh
external_lit=`which lit`
python build_tools/build_imex.py                        \
    --working-dir $local-working-dir-to-build-llvm  \
    --external-lit ${external_lit}
```

To reuse a previously built LLVM, use the following steps:

Make sure your LLVM install is built from the git commit sha as stated in
'build_tools/llvm_version.txt'.

```sh
external_lit=`which lit`
python build_tools/build_imex.py                        \
    --working-dir $local-working-dir-to-build-llvm  \
    --llvm-install $llvm-target-dir                 \
    --external-lit ${external_lit}
```

#### Building Bare Metal With Existing LLVM/MLIR
Make sure your LLVM install is built from the git commit sha as stated in
'build_tools/llvm_version.txt'.
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9 MLIR_DIR=<llvm-install-directory> cmake ..
make -j 12


For GPU support, pass the cmake variables to enable the required runtime libraries

CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9 MLIR_DIR=<llvm-install-directory> cmake .. -DSYCL_DIR=/PATH_TO/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/linux/ -DLEVEL_ZERO_DIR=/PATH_TO/level-zero-install/ -DIMEX_ENABLE_L0_RUNTIME=1 -DIMEX_ENABLE_SYCL_RUNTIME=1
make -j 12
```

#### Building as an LLVM external project
You can also build IMEX as an LLVM external project.
```
git clone https://github.com/intel/mlir-extensions.git
cd mlir-extensions
git checkout refactor
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
git checkout `cat ../mlir-extensions/build_tools/llvm_version.txt`
cmake -G Ninja -B build -S llvm \
   -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir \
   -DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
   -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
   -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
   -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_PROJECTS="Imex" \
   -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_IMEX_SOURCE_DIR=../mlir-extensions

cmake --build build --target check-imex
```
**Note**: `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON` is not needed for this build since all tests
will run using `FileCheck` utility in LLVM built tree.
External `lit` is not needed as well since all tests will run using `llvm-lit`
in the LLVM build tree.

#### Building docs
To build user documentation do
```sh
cd build
cmake --build . --target mlir-doc
```
It will render docs to the 'doc' directory.

To build code documentation use '-DIMEX_INCLUDE_DOCS' when configuring with cmake and do
```sh
cd build
cmake --build . --target doc_doxygen
```

## Adding a new dialect
```sh
# enter root directory of mlir-extension
cd mlir-extensions
python scripts/add_dialect.py <name-of-new-dialect>
```
This will
* generate directories `IR` and `Transforms` in the directories (`include/mlir/Dialect`
  and `lib/dialect`)
* Extend/Create cmake infrastructure with defaults
* Create stub source files for IR and transforms
  - `include/imex/Dialect/<name>/IR/<name>Ops.h`
  - `include/imex/Dialect/<name>/IR/<name>Ops.td`
  - `lib/Dialect/IR/<name>Ops.cpp`
  - `include/imex/Dialect/<name>/Transforms/Passes.h`
  - `include/imex/Dialect/<name>/Transforms/Passes.td`
  - `lib/Dialect/Transforms/PassDetail.h`

Now, it's your turn to
* Add your dialect and its transforms/passes to appropriate places in
  - `include/imex/InitIMEXDialects.h`
  - `include/imex/InitIMEXPasses.h`
  - `lib/Conversion/IMEXPassDetail.h`
* Fill in what's marked with FIXME
* The documentation of the dialect should go into the `description` fields in `<name>Ops.td`. At build time the description
will be extracted and a file `doc/<name>.md` will be generated automatically. It will include descriptions of the dialect and operations in a standardized way.

## Adding a new Conversion
```sh
# enter root directory of mlir-extension
cd mlir-extensions
python scripts/add_conversion.py $name-of-source-dialect $name-of-target-dialect
```
This will
* Let $conversion-name name be "$name-of-source-dialectTo$name-of-target-dialect"
* Add directories `include/mlir/Conversion/<conversion-name>` and `lib/Conversion/<conversion-name>`
* Extend/Create cmake infrastructure with defaults
* Add declarations to header `include/mlir/Conversion/<conversion-name>/<conversion-name>.h`
* Put cpp definition stubs to `lib/Conversion/<conversion-name>/<conversion-name>.cpp`
* Add conversion to `include/imex/Conversion/IMEXPasses.td and include/imex/Conversion/IMEXPasses.h`
* Add a pass def stub to `include/imex/Conversion/IMEXPasses.td and include/imex/Conversion/Passes.td`

You will now have to
* Fill in the above files what's marked with FIXME
* The documentation of the pass should go into the `description` field in `Passes.td`. At build time the description
will be extracted and a file `doc/Conversions.md` will be generated automatically.
* Write your Pattern rewriters


## Getting Level Zero loader (Optional, needed for GPU support with Level zero runtime)
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/level-zero.git
cd level-zero
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../level-zero -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../level-zero-install
ninja install
```

## Getting DPC++ compiler (Optional, needed for GPU support with Sycl runtime)
```
Install DPC++ compiler : Instructions here
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html#dpcpp-cpp

Once DPC++ is installed source the compiler vars:
source /PATH_TO/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/env/vars.sh
```

## Run the lit tests
To run the FileCheck based tests, follow the following steps:

```sh
cd <to your IMEX build directory>
cmake --build . --target check-imex
```
Add '-v' to the above command-line to get verbose output.
